# LFG — full autonomous workflow

Execute a complete engineering workflow with verification at each phase. The phases below exist because skipping any one of them has caused a production bug at least once — the checklist is load-bearing.

## Phase 0: Branch setup

1. `git branch --show-current`
2. If not on `main`: `git checkout main`
3. `git pull origin main`
4. `git checkout -b issue-{number}-{brief-description}` (or `feature/{description}` if no issue)

## Phase 1: Understand

If `$ARGUMENTS` is a GitHub issue number/URL:

```bash
gh issue view <number> --json title,body,labels,assignees,comments
```

Define explicit acceptance criteria (GIVEN / WHEN / THEN). Don't proceed until you can articulate them.

**Comprehension gate** — answer all five before writing code:

1. State the problem in one sentence.
2. Why is it needed?
3. What changes from the user's perspective?
4. What edge cases aren't explicit?
5. What data flow / code path is involved?

Use `TaskCreate` to record steps; update as you go.

## Phase 2: Explore

1. Find related files (Glob/Grep, or the Explore agent for broad searches).
2. Read existing patterns in similar features.
3. Understand dependencies and integration points.
4. Check existing test coverage.

## Phase 3: Plan

1. List files to modify with specific changes.
2. List new files to create with their purpose.
3. Plan test coverage (tests first).
4. Update the task list.

## Phase 4: Implement (TDD)

For each logical unit:

### 4.1 Failing test first

Create a test that demonstrates the expected behavior. Confirm it fails for the right reason:

```bash
bun test path/to/file.test.ts
```

### 4.2 Minimum implementation

Project conventions:

| Use | Instead of |
|-----|-----------|
| `Zazu` client (`new Zazu({ apiKey })`) | hand-rolled `fetch` |
| `Page<T>` from the SDK | manual cursor loop |
| `instanceof ZazuValidationError` etc. | status-code switching |
| `import type { ... }` for type-only imports | mixed runtime + type imports |
| snake_case for wire-format response bodies | auto-camelCasing |
| `bun test` | jest, mocha, vitest |
| `biome check` | eslint + prettier separately |
| Cassette replay via `test/cassette-replay.ts` | mocking `fetch` per test |

### 4.3 Refactor

Once green, refactor with tests still passing.

### 4.4 Validate

```bash
bun run check:all   # typecheck + lint + test
bun run lint:fix    # auto-apply Biome safe fixes
```

### 4.5 Repeat

Move to the next unit. Mark task items complete as you finish them.

## Phase 5: Deep root-cause analysis (bug fixes only)

For bug fixes, investigate before implementing:

- **Trace the data lifecycle** — where was the value created, how did it reach the failure point, what assumption broke?
- **Use git history** — `git log --oneline -20 <file>`, `git blame <file>`. Was a guard there before? Why was it removed/added?
- **Map callers** — grep for callers of the failing function; does the bug only show up in one context?
- **Five whys** — keep asking "why" until you reach a meaningful fix point.

**Fix-location principle**: the best fix is rarely where the error is raised. Ask "where is the earliest point I could prevent this error?" Fix there.

**Superficial fixes to avoid**:
- `?.` chaining without understanding why the value is undefined
- `try/catch` that swallows the error
- Changing `throw` paths to silent returns
- Type assertions (`as Foo`) instead of fixing the producer

## Phase 6: Verify

All must pass before committing:

```bash
bun run typecheck                    # tsc --noEmit
bun run lint                         # biome check (errors on warnings)
bun test                             # bun test (all green)
bun run build                        # confirm publishable artifact builds
```

Re-read the original requirements: would the requester consider this fully resolved? Have you addressed the root cause? Do the tests prove the fix?

## Phase 7: Commit and PR

**Backticks in PR bodies pass through `<<'EOF'` heredocs verbatim — do NOT escape them with `` \` ``.** See the "PR descriptions" section in `CLAUDE.md`.

```bash
git add <specific_files>
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat(scope): brief description

## Summary
[What changed and why]

## Test Coverage
- test 1: validates requirement X
- test 2: validates edge case Y

## Verification
- [x] bun run typecheck
- [x] bun run lint
- [x] bun test
- [x] bun run build
EOF
)"

git push -u origin $(git branch --show-current)

gh pr create --title "feat(scope): brief description" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
- Key change 1 — uses `Page<T>` from the SDK
- Key change 2

Closes #<issue_number>

## Test plan
- [ ] Scenario 1
- [ ] Scenario 2
EOF
)"
```

If you typed `` \` `` anywhere in the body, delete the backslash. The single-quoted EOF delimiter is doing all the shell-escaping work.

## Verification checklist

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met.
- [ ] Tests written before implementation.
- [ ] `bun run typecheck` passes.
- [ ] `bun run lint` passes (no warnings).
- [ ] `bun test` passes.
- [ ] `bun run build` produces a clean dist/.
- [ ] No hand-rolled HTTP — uses the SDK.
- [ ] PR created with description.

## Karpathy guidelines (always)

These reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Apply on every change, not just LFG runs:

1. **Think before coding** — surface assumptions, push back on overcomplication, ask when unclear.
2. **Simplicity first** — minimum code that solves the problem, no speculative abstractions.
3. **Surgical changes** — touch only what you must; clean up your own orphans, not pre-existing dead code.
4. **Goal-driven execution** — define success criteria as a verifiable test, loop until verified.
